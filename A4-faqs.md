Questions about what this page is.

### So what am I looking at here?

This is a webpage I made -- imitating the style of Kickstarter -- to help me recruit a support network for the book project I'm about to start working on in earnest.

### So do you want my money?

No! I'm being supported by a Jepson Fellowship from my institution. This fellowship grants me a reduced teaching load for the 2013-14 academic year, which should give me time to work on this book.

### So what do you want, if not money?

Just your time, attention, and a little feedback. As I think in the long term about this project, the one fact I kept returning to is that I can't do this alone. When I worked on Playing the Past, I had a co-editor and a team of authors to represent and be inspired by. When I completed my dissertation, I had two excellent mentors (Donald Ault and Terry Harpold). 

To write this book, essentially a sequel to my dissertation, I feel confident in the topic and in my ability to do the research, but I want to make this book as good as it can be, and I can't do that alone. My other projects have all gotten done with the support of a community, so why should I go this one alone?

### OK, so how can I help?

Just like Kickstarter, I'm offering different levels of support, measured in terms of time ranging from 5 minutes to 8 hours. If you believe in this project or in me, select a time commitment from the list on the right side of the main page.

### What's in it for me?

I realize that most Kickstarter projects involve some kind of reward. In academia, our commodities are time and CV lines. At a minimum, if you support this project by committing even 5 minutes to its success, you'll have my gratitude and a standing commitment that I'll happily reciprocate some of my time toward supporting your next project. At the higher levels of support, I can start offering in-text acknowledgement and copies of the finished book. Read the descripton of each pledge level to see the specifics.
