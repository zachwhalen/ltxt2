Analyzing videogames as medially-layered cultural artifacts is an increasingly influential
and relevant approach in the field of game studies. This article extends this approach with
the metaphor of archaeology to argue that the “layered” or “leveled” analytical structures
employed by Lars Konzack, Nick Montfort, Espen Aarseth and others can be extended by
considering how the artifacts embedded in these layers reveal the dialectical or discursive
relationships among them. Just as an archeologist infers relationships among time periods
and cultures, I argue that the contextualization of medial layers in videogame texts can be
elucidated with an understanding of the artifacts or disruptions which occur at the
intersections of game layers. By analyzing different versions of the videogame Berzerk,
this article demonstrates how typographic analysis can characterize the expressive
capabilities of a platform and how alphanumeric character design can anticipate or depend
on the often-overlooked layer of the television screen.
