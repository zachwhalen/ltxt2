# A TYPOGRAPHIC ARCHAEOLOGY OF BERZERK

## Abstract

Analyzing videogames as medially-layered cultural artifacts is an increasingly influential
and relevant approach in the field of game studies. This article extends this approach with
the metaphor of archaeology to argue that the “layered” or “leveled” analytical structures
employed by Lars Konzack, Nick Montfort, Espen Aarseth and others can be extended by
considering how the artifacts embedded in these layers reveal the dialectical or discursive
relationships among them. Just as an archeologist infers relationships among time periods
and cultures, I argue that the contextualization of medial layers in videogame texts can be
elucidated with an understanding of the artifacts or disruptions which occur at the
intersections of game layers. By analyzing different versions of the videogame Berzerk,
this article demonstrates how typographic analysis can characterize the expressive
capabilities of a platform and how alphanumeric character design can anticipate or depend
on the often-overlooked layer of the television screen.

Studying videogames requires an archaeological approach – digging down through layers
of culture, context, and platform to learn more about the artifacts that constitute the gaming
phenomena. In order to fully understand these objects, we must begin by understanding the
technological affordances which their expression relies on – the intertwining materiality of the
technical strata which work together in producing a single game image, experience or text. In
this article, I offer a stratigraphic reading of multiple versions of the videogame Berzerk (Stern
Electronics, 1980). Specifically, I argue that an analysis of the typography of each version
reveals unique expressive properties of that respective platform. The typeface emulated in one
instance of Berzerk (for the Atari 2600 console) models the form of a popular typeface of the
1960s, CountdownTM, which is often associated (often parodically) with computer interfaces, but
the extent that it does so depends on the interference of screen artifacts at the level of image
generation. Significantly, the degree to which Berzerk’s text successfully matches this face
depends on the artifacts of a particular phenomenal game “layer” that often goes ignored, the
phosphor screen of common CRT televisions.

This means of achieving identity is important because it mobilizes the archaeological
metaphor in two senses. First, the interferences of the screen, radio frequency noise, and any
other intrusions are typically referred to as artifacts because they impede image transmission or
image quality. One common example of this sort of artifact manifests clearly in JPEG images (a
so-called “lossy” format) that have been greatly compressed. In this sense, an artifact is a mark
on the image which indicates the presence of the technology supporting the image. The
distinctive appearance of JPEG artifacts distinguishes these images from, for example, PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) images which are in turn labeled “lossless.” Therefore, an inference 
based upon marks on the object allows one to conjecture, like an archaeologist, a historical
setting for that object.

The second sense in which the term artifact is important to the archaeological metaphor is
that it emphasizes the historical situation of the game itself. In literary and linguistic studies, the
status of the physical text (including page layout, typography, printing quality) as a component
of the text’s meaning has had a relatively recent resurgence. In criticizing prevailing views of
textual criticism, particularly those dependent on the ideology of authorship as the sole locus of
critical interpretation, Jerome McGann has proposed an alternative program for textual studies,
one which recovers the diachronic and social aspects of literature through “the operation of a
complex structure of analysis which considers the history of the text in relation to the related
histories of its production, reproduction, and reception” (McGann, 1983, p. 123). Similarly,
Johanna Drucker has written extensively on the importance of the material and visual domains of
meaning in literature, and specifically with regard to typography, Drucker argues that it is
uniquely suited for studying critical practices. “Because of its interdisciplinary character, the
treatment of typography within critical interpretation can be used to trace the transformations in
the premises on which both literary and visual arts criticism conceive of their object” (Drucker,
1996, p. 1). This article seeks to conceive the game object by way of an analysis of its
typography and in so doing, to outline a program of study which uncovers the diachronic, social
aspects of videogames by way of the physical and material circumstances of their production and
reception.

One way of indexing those circumstances is through the alternate regimes of representation
which I refer to as “jaggy” or “fuzzy.” These are two broad descriptors for different means of
rendering type in and around videogames; type in videogames may be rendered in a manner
which is jaggy or fuzzy, depending on the technology, and type which exists in reference to
videogames (for example, on arcade cabinets) may also employ fuzziness or jagginess as a
reference to the display rendering which creates either condition. One common instance of jaggy
type occurs in most videogame emulators – software which reproduces a game platform – on
modern personal computers. Because the monitor’s display will generally be far crisper than
those available to game players in the early 1980s, the experience of playing the game today is
slightly altered. Compare, for example, the two versions of the title screen for Atari’s adaptation
of Dig Dug (figure 2). In the first image, the stair-stepped edges of the letters’ diagonal edges
create a jaggy line which is only as smooth as the resolution allows. In the second image, the
jagginess is minimized and the line appears smoother and more continuous because it benefits
from the slight distortion it experiences from screen artifacts.

These effects are far from accidental. For example, Compute!’s Second Book of Atari
Graphics includes a chapter devoted to techniques for taking advantage of screen artifacts for
improved visual effects.1 Still, the point is not that either fuzzy or jaggy type is a better or more
faithful rendition of any ideal design of a character or the designer’s intended appearance.
Rather, both afford different mediations of constraint that allow them to reference a specific set
of technology (i.e., either an emulator or a physical console) even when a different artifactual
layer such as print intervenes. In this way, arcade flyers, t-shirts and website designs can
accomplish a specific association which operates conceptually at the layer of the screen. This
ability of fuzzy and jaggy suggests the importance of understanding the effects screen as part of
any approach to videogame study, but in fact the screen is typically taken for granted in the
existing literature, though its utility as a metaphor for computing is significant in this context.

## Levels and Layers

Among the many attempts to formulate a critical concept of videogame structure
(ontological or otherwise), one recurring theme is an organizational heuristic based in levels or
layers. Nick Montfort’s article, “Combat in Context,” proposes a five-level model for videogame
analysis that he repeats when describing the book series he is co-editing with Ian Bogost (2007).
Interestingly, Bogost and Montfort chose to use a different graphic for portraying the levels. The
difference is interesting, even though it may have originated in purely aesthetic considerations,
because it places a different emphasis on relationships among the levels. In both the article and
the discussion on the Platform Studies website, Montfort arranges game content into the
following five levels: 1) platform; 2) game code; 3) game form; 4) game interface; 5) reception
& operation (2006). The two illustrations appear in figure 3. The first (3A) is from Montfort’s
Game Studies article where it retains the ordinals employed in the initial list he provides of the
levels. The second (3B) is from the website introducing the Platform Studies book series. Note
that in the example from the website, Montfort and Bogost have removed the ordinals and
instead illustrate degrees of separation as a gradation of color such that the platform level is the
darkest or most dense level – a fitting characterization for a foundational substratum. This is
significant because 3B implies a degree of co-involvement and dependency that is missing from
the discrete, padded cells and strict ordinals of 3A. In other words, figure 3A presents the five
levels as being jaggy, whereas figure 3A illustrates the relationship in a way that is more fuzzy.

Besides responding specifically to Lars Konzack’s (2002) seven-layer model for game
analysis,2 Montfort also addresses other approaches which stratify videogame content for the
purposes of study. Julian Kücklich also deals with one such approach in his article, “Perspectives
of Computer Game Philology,” where Kücklich caricatures the much-maligned, so-called
“narratological” approach3 to computer game study that “blindly equat[es] a computer game’s
technical levels of its code and its interface with the narratological levels of story and discourse”
(2003). Kücklich sees this equation as a problem and provides a different, also dually-layered
constructivist model where games are treated as non-trivial machines with embedded trivial
machines (adopting Espen Aarseth’s terminology) that consist of processes of adaptation. What
is important here about Kücklich’s straightforward criticism of a narratological model and his
response to it is that both employ levels as a metaphor for a conceptual relationship among
differently functioning sub-phenomena. In responding to the initial, assumed hierarchy, a
different hierarchy is exchanged for the original.

It is also significant that Kücklich arrives at his proposal by closing off the code as external
to the process of gameplay and that he does so by invoking the screen as a metaphor: “Usually,
the only thing the player knows about the world of the game is what is displayed on the screen.
However, the player is able to learn about the implicit rules of the game simply by interacting
with it for a sufficient amount of time” (2003, my emphasis). As he is using it here, Kücklich
means something synomymous with actually or literally when he writes “on the screen;” his
point is that players only come in contact with the game world as they actually perceive it with
their senses. But the figure of speech he chooses here is significant because it suggests the dual
nature by which the videogame screen becomes a physical but transparent threshold between the
game world and the real world at the same time that it is a conduit connecting those two worlds.
It also indicates how the material structure of the game text influences intellectual discourse
about games, even when that discourse is not directly relevant to material structures and their
influences.

Another common stratification of game content worth noting is condensed into the
following syllogism declared by Aarseth in his “Genre Trouble” essay: “Any game consists of
three aspects: (1) rules, (2) a material/semiotic system (a gameworld), and (3) gameplay (the
events resulting from application of the rules to the gameworld)” (2004, p. 48). This is the core
taxonomy most clearly articulated by Jesper Juul4 and most aggressively defended by Markku
Eskelinen.5 The advantage of this ludological approach is that it allows videogames to be
analyzed a long history of games and play that is as ancient as culture itself. However, when in
practice this formal separation privileges rules at the exclusion of semantic context (as Aarseth
elaborates in his essay), Stuart Moulthroup seems correct in calling the insularity of this
allegedly self-contained system, “alarmingly narrow” (2004, p. 48). The fact that Aarseth
introduces the second aspect by conflating or combining materiality and semiotics and offering
further clarification that he is referring to the “gameworld,” suggests that there is something
more complicated going on here that merits more than a single category. In other words,
regardless of how one treats the phenomenon of gameplay, it is clear that some meaning and
referentiality must be inferred from the various (and possibly competing) rhetorics of simulation
and representation. Furthermore, although Aarseth does not specifically use the term levels, it is
clear from the primacy he places on rules that he intends some degree of stratigraphy (however
ordered) in relating the 3 aspects of gameplay he identifies.

Though his is not necessarily a direct response to the ludology conversation, Alexander
Galloway’s approach introduced in Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture (2006) demonstrates
one way of understanding how the material/semiotic dimension of the gameworld can influences
a game’s ability to express meaning, which is an important way in which Montfort’s levels can
interact with one another. As Galloway observes, “the shape and size of Mario in the NES
version of Super Mario Bros. is determined not simply by artistic intention or narrative logic but
by the design specifications of the 8-bit 6502 microchip driving the game software” (2006, p.
32). Furthermore, this sense in which game characters are embodiments of “math made visible”
(Galloway, 2006, p. 32) is continuous with control structures that determine formal actions
within the game since these are dictated by informatic principles that drive software. In a similar
approach, Ian Bogost’s unit operations (2006) creates an analytical method from the object-
oriented logic of software, identifying both software (rules) and the gameworld as systems
constructed on the basis of separate but interdependent units. Both Bogost’s and Galloway’s
approaches are consistent with Montfort’s five-level model, and taken together, these methods
and assertions amount to what Montfort and Bogost have labeled “platform studies.”

The logic of platform studies offers much that informs the present typographic approach to
videogame textuality. Because a significant characteristic of game typography is the extent to
which it relies on and exploits the constraints of the game platform, the typographic approach
presented in this article is very much in harmony with the overarching logic of platform studies.
To illustrate this, I offer the following analysis of the videogame Berzerk.

## Berzerk

The first incarnation of Berzerk was programmed in 1980 by Alan McNeil for Stern
Electronics (“Berzerk Videogame by Stern”). The game consists of a “humanoid” character
fighting off talking robots and a bouncing smiley face named Evil Otto who chases the humanoid
protagonist through a dark maze. In terms of the content of its loosely implied story, Berzerk
could be considered an aesthetic forerunner to DOOM (id Software, 1993), and like DOOM,
Berzerk also generated its share of controversy. Berzerk is the first game known to contribute to
a player’s death (Kiesling, 1982, p. 14), and it became a target of early videogame critics who
decried its presentation of humanoid on robot violence. Thomas Radecki, then chairman of the
National Coalition on Television Violence, wrote in 1983, “the object is to kill as many other
stick figures as possible, before they kill you ... This type of role-playing practice is certain to
have long-term harmful effects on the player; it teaches violent reactions” (Qtd. in Sullivan,
1983, p. 70). Significantly, Radecki’s criticism here does not identify the act of killing as
affectively realistic. Rather, he objects to a symbolic act which depends not on the resemblance
of the Automazeons to humans, but rather on the symbolic relationship between their iconic,
stick figure presentations. The graphical impetus for this moral panic is an important point for
contextualizing the game in terms of genre – Berzerk is a prototypical third-person shoot-em-up
– but it is also a relevant point of comparison among the other versions of the game as it was
ported to multiple console systems.

Not including the arcade sequel Frenzy (Stern Electronics, 1982), Berzerk saw four
licensed translations to other platforms, including versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, GCE
Vectrex, and a board game by Milton-Bradley.6 It is interesting to note the varying paratextual
renditions of the humanoid, Automazeons, and Evil Otto that accompany the various
translations, but it is more important to note how the shapes used to render text reveal a discourse
of materiality which, following Montfort’s terminology, connect and complicate the platform
level with the interface level. This co-involvement seems to follow Montfort’s own thinking
when he drops the ordinals in representing level order for introducing Platform Studies (figure
3A). That is, whereas listing platform as the “first” level and placing it at the bottom of the stack
affords it a place of determined primacy, removing the ordinal and simply placing it at the
bottom signifies its foundational status without implying as strong a conceptual dependency on
the part of the other levels. The fact that multiple versions of Berzerk that are mostly similar can
co-exist at all means that, in a purely practical sense, the programmers working on the
adaptations at least began with a common form/function level. The differences which do appear
in different versions of Berzerk illustrate what happens as programmers attempt to retain the
same textual and typographic material while changing platforms. The result is a relationship
between levels where contingencies and propensities of each platform have enforced
compromises (or improvements) in the game form and interface that manifest at the level of
reception and operation.

Figure 4 shows screenshots from the four licensed versions of Berzerk. At first glance, the
games appear to be similar, and in fact, at the level of form, one might well argue that these are
in most respects identical. Some slight variations do, however, change the gameplay
significantly. In the Atari 2600 version, for example, the robots are not programmed to fire their
lasers in all eight directions, so the player (who can fire in eight directions) can gain a tactical
advantage by approaching Automazeons diagonally. Also, in the Vectrex version, the player’s
sprite is comprised of a continuous set of vector lines so that there is no gap between the player-
character’s head and shoulders. This gap in the other versions can allow a laser to pass through
without harming the player. The so-called “bulletproof bowtie” technique is only useful as a last
resort, but it works because of choices McNeil made when he designed the stick figure’s body.
The reason for this design is apparent in the artwork for the original flyer advertising Berzerk
(figure 5). Despite the fact that the sprite contains a gap between the head and body of the figure,
the fuzzying effects of the raster display artifacts blur the edges of the stick figure’s form so that
his head appears to be connected to the rest of his body. The gap one sees in the emulated, jaggy
versions (figure 6) results from the more crisp display technology used by the emulator software
and the user’s monitor itself. In this way, the figure’s form, which depends on artifacts of both
the platform and the display, also affects game play and the experience or interpretation of the
game text.

The Arabic numeral 3 provides reflects a more subtle variation that reveals how pervasive
the interactions and influences are among the levels of the game object. Figure 7Error!
Reference source not found. shows the numeral 3 as it is rendered on the various platforms,
each by way of an emulator. The 3s from the Atari 2600 version and the Vectrex version are the
most obviously different because the Vectrex display attempts to adapt a raster composition
similar to the arcade and 5200 versions for its vector display system and the 2600 employs an
entirely different shape for the numeral. The form in figure 7B exhibits characteristics
fundamental to jagginess, the most prominent of which are the visible pixels which compose the
numeral shape itself and constrain its form to that which can be drawn at that output resolution.
Figure 8 illustrates this compositional logic by highlighting and isolating one such pixel.
The highlighted pixel in figure 8A illustrates a crucial point in terms of Montfort’s levels.
Montfort’s main improvement on Konzack is that each of his levels is considered to be
influenced by its cultural context. In other words, the game object is surrounded by context at all
layers rather than finding context only in its reception – projecting each expression outward from
a categorically ideal, lower-level code that works its way through progressively disruptive levels
until finally coming into contact with the real world. Instead for Montfort context, and therefore
criticism, can intervene at any level and can be considered in its own terms. As a logical
extension to this idea, each level is in turn part of the context of every other level and can be
employed as a critical tool to unlock its co-involved fellow levels. The image of the numeral 3 in
figure 8 highlights a single pixel, which is important because its jaggy appearance and visually
discrete sub-units (pixels) mimic the actual digital composition of the game’s code. In this way,
the fourth level (interface) communicates something about the first level (code), but the degree to
which it does so depends on a level which lies external to Montfort’s model, the physical
conditions of the display technology.

Berzerk on Atari 2600

Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between Berzerk’s binary data and the numeral 3 as
generated by the emulator Stella. The Atari 2600 lacked a native text rendering engine, so game
designers had to allow space in each game’s ROM for storing bitmap images of the needed
characters. The game program includes instructions that call up a specified segment of code
which contains a graphic representation of the Arabic numeral “3.” That section of code has no
inherent three-ness that is interfaced programmatically other than the context of its being called
when the digit, three, is required for representing the player’s score or other numeric values.

In figure 9A, I have converted the game’s code into a visually accessible form by
processing it with a program that represents each positive value (binary 1) as a capital X and
each negative value (binary 0) as a period. The numbers in the left column indicate the memory
addresses where the example bytes reside within the game’s ROM file. To create the image on
the right (and the similar preceding images), I used the emulator Stella’s built-in snapshot
function to capture the emulator’s output to a bitmap file. I then enlarged the image in a graphics
program making sure that the software did not distort or otherwise attempt to anti-alias the
image. The jagginess is maintained, and juxtaposing these two images shows that, in this
example, both code and screenshot are jaggy. Representing the code visually does introduce
another level of interpretation and interference, but the on/off logic it illustrates is true to the
digital character of the storage media. Like the edges of the image in 9B, the bit positions in the
ROM must be either on or off to communicate the correct image data to the screen. The image
Stella generates can be considered a rather accurate rendering of the original image, but its
fidelity in this example depends on the way Stella draws the image to the screen as well as the
way I captured and manipulated the image. Significantly, this process intercepts the image before
it is transmitted to the screen buffer, so it effectively ignores any influence that the screen might
have on the appearance and referential quality of the image.

The impact of the monitor is, however, quite apparent in figure 10 where the image in 10B
is a different capture of the same numeral 3 represented in figure 9B. In this case, I made the
initial capture of the image by photographing the monitor at a very close distance and then
enlarging that digital photograph. The difference between the screenshot 3 and the photograph 3
reveals that, in the case of 10B, the congruity of the generated image to the divisions of the
display surface of the screen results in a 3 that is more jaggy, which is significant here because
the jaggy 3 creates an illusion of greater fidelity to an ideal, un-mediated 3 image. Each
generated pixel is divided neatly into four display pixels, and the edges of the generated pixels
are flush with the edges of the screen’s cells. However, as the photograph reveals, the rectilinear
structure of the pixels is not actually continuous. Their subdivision reveals their edges not to be
true lines at all but, rather, points of light arranged in a matrix which the eye combines into a
continuous line when viewing it at a sufficient distance. The difference this makes is that
whereas the photographed, enlarged image (10B) emphasizes the effects of the screen layer, the
screenshot image (9B) attempts to ignore it.

This is why the use of jaggy type is so significant. It is not reclaiming the aesthetic of the
screen grid, as is often implied, but is instead foregrounding the logical matrix of the game’s
machine code. This is not to say that the jaggy numeral three in figure 9B is more authentic to
the game experience or a better, more ideal 3, but that it expresses something about the nature of
the game image, namely that its digital origin imposes graphical limitations and that the aesthetic
effect of those limitations is not necessarily a bad thing. If the imagery of game emulators
expresses a rhetoric of nostalgia, it is nostalgia that creates an imaginary ideal game image where
the screen as a medium itself is invisible. As an alternative, if figure 10 makes an allowance for
the regime of the screen as a signifier of mediality, then figure 11 puts it right in the foreground.

This final in-game example illustrates a more dramatic influence of materiality. The image
is a photograph of the numeral 3 generated by an actual Atari 2600 and displayed on a normal
CRT television. The raster scan lines, phosphorescence, and the resulting halation on the figure
are all natural conditions of the display medium that affect the shape of the 3 in important ways.
Note the irregularity of the (logical) pixels and their tendency to swell at inner corners and
narrow at the endpoints of posts. The corners are all rounded, and the bright, positive space of
the shape blends relatively gradually with the black negative space of the field. Like the Dig Dug
logotype in figure 2B, this image is inherently and unself-consciously fuzzy and it clearly
emphasizes the influence of the screen on the rendered text image. Moreover, besides expressing
a specific quality through the game’s interface level that affects its reception level, this image
also suggests something about the platform and original source code: specifically, one possibility
as to why this shape was chosen for the numeral rather than the form used for the arcade version.
Another instance of this version of the 3 (that is, it is the same in terms of its functional
representation within the structure of the Atari VCS game) proves illuminating in this regard.

The 3 illustrated in figure 12 performs the same numerical signification within the printed,
simulated game as the 3’s in both game images in figures 8 - 11.7 This image appears in the
instruction manual for Atari’s adaptation of Berzerk for the 2600, and it is clearly an illustration
rather than a photograph because the lines of the laser beam are unbroken diagonals as opposed
to the stair-stepped missiles appearing in the game. The angle these lines illustrate is also far
steeper than what actually appears in the game. More importantly, the shape of the numeral 3,
while retaining its basic form, has changed somewhat dramatically with regard to the outline of
its inner post, as illustrated in figure 12B. The line that was previously a short post comprising a
single pixel and a single code bit has now become a gradually tapering point. This printed, fuzzy
image of the numeral 3 is quite a departure from the jaggy 3 in figure 8, but if anything, it has a
stronger resemblance to the fuzzy 3 in figure 11. From this association, it is possible to surmise
that the anonymous graphic artist who prepared this illustration of the screen image was using a
CRT display image as a reference. Another possibility is that the artist deemed the narrow post
too small to be legible at the printed resolution of the manual. In either case, fuzziness has here
been adopted in order to increase legibility and strengthen an association between a print image
and a screen image. This association invites considering the fuzzy screen image (interface level)
within the context of the print image (reception and operation level), but the print image could
also be a considered part of the interface level since it invokes the interface literally by adopting
the aesthetic regime of the screen at the same time that it negotiates its own constraints. This
connection between the print image and the screen image also indicates one possible inspiration
for the typeface used in the Atari 2600 Berzerk: the shapes of the numerals in Berzerk appear to
be adapted from CountdownTM, a typeface Colin Brignall designed in 1965 for Letraset.

Table 1 shows the numeral forms in Countdown and how they appear to have been adapted
to the bitmap grid constraint. The first column contains a sample from Countdown, the second
shows a representation of the code for that numeral, and the third column contains a photograph
of that numeral on a CRT television screen. Taken together, these images illustrate the visual
relationship of the source bitmap and the graphical realization of that shape on a television
screen. Some differences are apparent (the variable x-height in Countdown has been made
uniform in Berzerk and the Berzerk forms are proportionally wider), but some key features
remain intact such as the asymmetrical weight of lines in the 0s and the alternation of thick and
thin lines in the 8s. While it is not enough of a similarity to call Berzerk’s typography an
implementation of Countdown, the typeface’s influence on Berzerk’s design is clear.8

With regard to the numeral 3, the introduction of a tapering point seems to strengthen this
association with Countdown since one of the typeface’s defining features is the way Brignall
used rounded internal and external corners in a way that mimics the effects of halation and light
buildup. Whether or not Brignall actually intended to simulate screen display technology of the
mid 1960s, the letter forms he created have proven well-adapted for that environment and,
therefore, well-suited in other contexts to referencing screen-based media as its adaptation in
Berzerk and frequent uses in arcade cabinet graphics and posters indicate. Accordingly, we can
infer that when Dan Hitchens ported Berzerk to the Atari 2600 (“ Berzerk (Atari),” 2007), he
chose to imitate this typeface either because of its well-established association with other game
and science fiction texts or because its structural characteristics which established that
association increased the letters’ and numbers’ legibility even (or especially) with the presence
of light buildup and halation. The bitmaps of the numeral shapes lack this fuzzy effect, so one
way to describe the adaptation of Countdown is that Berzerk’s version of the typeface is not fully
composed until it has undergone the fuzzying influence of the CRT screen.

## Berzerk on the Vectrex

The Vectrex version of Berzerk is also quite different from the arcade version for reasons
related to the console hardware, and because the Vectrex is a significantly different platform, it is
useful to compare its version to the Atari 2600’s. First, the Vectrex uses a more advanced BIOS,
which contains ASCII characters that can be accessed within games by employing a numeric
code.9 Unlike the Atari VCS where alphanumeric characters have to be stored in bitmap form
within each individual game’s ROM, Vectrex games can call on the device’s internal library of
letter and number shapes. Second, the forms of these characters are interesting because they
employ a raster composition method within a vector display environment. Letter forms are,
therefore, composed of unbroken horizontal lines which fill in the internal space of the letter
shape. This is different from other vector display systems like those used in the arcade games
Asteroids, Battlezone, and Tempest, which draw letter shapes using vector lines that delineate the
strokes of the letters themselves (see figure 13).

The fact that the display is only capable of drawing monochrome images in white lines
also has an impact on the appearance of shapes on the Vectrex. Color is achieved by using
transparent overlays specifically created for each game, which rest in a tray about 3⁄4” from the
screen surface. In the case of Berzerk, the overlay simply gives the game images a blue tint, but
it also serves to soften the appearance of the otherwise harshly bright vector lines. This softening
also helps alleviate distortion that occurs in images toward the edges of the screen. A
consequence of the electron gun’s method for drawing vectors on the screen causes shapes near
the outer edges (like much of the text) to quiver or shake slightly, so applying a colored layer of
interference mitigates the distraction this may otherwise cause.

Figure 14 shows the effect the overlay has on the display of numerals in Berzerk. Other
than the color, the main difference is that the overlay introduces a softening or blurring effect on
the edges of the lines, leading to greater perceptible continuity within the lettershapes. In other
words, the un-modified Vectrex image can be considered jaggy, whereas the overlay causes it to
be slightly more fuzzy. It is important to note here that the overlay mitigates the distortion of
flickering and vibration by introducing a different order of distortion. In this way, the Vectrex
image that is literally dually-layered provides a convenient analogy for the differences between
emulated and actual game images. An actual television contains an additional layer (its screen)
which the emulated screenshot does not.

In terms of the game platform and its influence on design and referentiality, the reason a 3
looks the way it does in Berzerk for Vectrex is simply that that is how 3’s always look in Vectrex
games. This rather clearly demonstrates the influence a specific platform must have in
determining game content and expression, but it also means that the opportunity for uniquely
expressing a relationship among hardware, software, and a typeface does not exist on the Vectrex
in the way that it does on the Atari 2600. This shows how technological constraint can encourage
creativity and experimentation, which is one possible reason why programming games for the
Atari 2600 remains a popular hobby among enthusiasts.

## Conclusion

Successful type design for videogames depends on anticipating the felicities of each
potential layer the image must pass through, so understanding these layers is an important
component of a critical approach to videogame textuality. The appearance of alphanumeric
characters in videogames and their representations in other contexts which reference videogames
can be an important relay for the multi-layered, multiply-contextualized levels of textuality in
videogames. This affinity emerges as a result of the unique relationship videogames share with
typographic expression: the sense of dependency on the capabilities of technology for
constraining or freeing the forms which designers have available to them. A typographic
approach to videogame textuality unpacks the expressive content of videogames through the
figure of typography in order to better understand the workings of constraint on the videogame
form. In both, the effects of constraint are often taken for granted, which is generally the goal of
the designer or programmer. However, even contemporary videogames designed for high-
definition display output negotiate some forms of constraint, so in order to understand how the
affordances of game platforms influence their aesthetics, it is useful to look closely at relics from
gaming’s past where constraints manifest more clearly.
