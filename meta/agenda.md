These are some notes toward having an actual research agenda. I need to have one. It's my only way to avoid getting stuck.

For me and my purposes here, I think a research agenda is a set of topics that I want to pursue, as well as a set of projects that those topics and content will be applied for. I need to have research questions, in other words, and plans for how to disseminate those.

# Already committed writing
 ## HOL11
	> Still something to be said there.

 ## OCR
	> Work in progress. Should be fun going back in to my diss.

 ## Programming
	> Someday, surely.

 ## Modding cultures
	> long term, but important.

# Presentations
 ## Counterfactual Historiography
	> Fresh. Seemed to go over well. Could be expanded by counterfactualizing more thoroughly, as well as making it more theoretical on the abstract parts.
	> play up generations (pun it - character generators.)

 ## that ARGhive presentation from MLA
	> the only output for this probably would be a working project of some sort, and I don't know if I'd ever have the resources for that sort of thing. I'm also a little less interested ARGs lately, except that now I think of it, this could be combined with my un-fleshed-out ideas from 

 ## that ARG paper I did at Florida in 09 -- or was it 10 -- the one that put john cayley to sleep
	> I think I did have some good ideas there, but perhaps not the theoretical framing to unpack it. I could get that. The target is a platform study of the real world, which might just be "cultural studies."

 ## that code paper from SCMS'12
	> There's still something to do there

 ## MLA 12 paper "Close Enough"
	> Short and sweet and probably too specific to copypaste from. But the concept could be an anchor for other things. Like the rest of my typography crap. There's more to figure out there, like cord length and the actual distances from the screen. Might get me into apparatus theory, if that's still a thing.

 ## Quest for Saddam / Quest for Bush
	> I don't know. This is pretty old. Could be used as detailed side example in something else, maybe.

----------------
# Other Writing
 ## My critcode thing on presenting code. 
	> Could still be interesting. 

 ## My failed GAC submission
	> reframe it under media archaeology. Tighten it up. Bet it could work still.


-------------------
# New writing Ideas
 ## Something about Vectrex.
	> It's this whole thing about inscription, I think.

 ## Something about elit
	> I don't know. Some kind of code study perhaps.

 ## Something about comics
 	> digitality, repetition and difference

 ## Something about steganography
	> I still think that's pretty cool
 
 ## Something about sherlock holmes
	> it's a bit played out, but still maybe there's something there. Something with adaptation. I don't know.

 ## Something else about music in games
	> look at old platforms. Explore that connection with serialism perhaps.
	> Maybe make it more industry-connected this time.

------------
# Creative / Other Ideas
 ## ROMScrape 
	> can still work. Need to make sure the histogram approach is actually better, then start doing some big data type analysis with it. Raises questions about how big big data needs to be, I suppose. 

 ## Some kind of poetic procedural poem thing
 	> treat a poem as a tag cloud. Create a text with the word frequencies that generate that cloud. 
	> Create some kind of tool that continually checks those statistics. Record writing process with etherpad.
	> Figure that out to make the writing playback interactive.

 ## what else? Something creatively collaborative, let's say.

# Book 

This is still a thing. I need to start working it now, before I even know if Ive got the jepson, because the more I do now, the more likely it will be that I'll get the dang thing done. Some of the things I could do now include coming up with a plan for the structure. At the same time, I also still can and need to do some more research or learning in order to have more and more interesting things to say when I get into the structuring. Some of my basic questions could be re thought, perhaps. Let's try it:

 ## What are the origins and bases of videogame typefaces?
 
 ## How do stylized videogame fonts communicate an idea of gameness, or what do their dissemination teach us about video games that we wouldn't already know?

 ## Does, for example, a typeface reveal paradigmatically the functions of constraint that define a platform? There's that sherlock holmes example from that one story. 

 ## [What is a platform anyway, but an antecedent? ]
