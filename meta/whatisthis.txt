Right now, this is the product of an idle thought: use github for storing work in progress and tracking it somehow. Clearly, since this is all done in the open, it changes the stakes for processes of writing and basically makes it all weirdly visible. I have no idea if this will work or if I will even use it for anything, but it kind of makes sense. 

Maybe if I end up actually using this, and I somehow get a research grant, I can pay to have the repo closed while I write my book. That's a weird idea, isn't it?

I can use this more or less granularly, I suppose. Unless there's a way to set up something on my local computer that automatically pushes ever few minutes, then it might not make sense to give me the editing-type tracking. I could, also, use it to track versions of specific writing pieces at key moments ...

So, for this thing I just did at SCMS, I can upload the notes/drafty version I read from, and then if I ever revise it into, say, a blog entry, that becomes a version as well. Likewise for an article, etc.

Under this approach, I might as well use a common text format, so maybe I'll try markdown. That's easy to write quickly.

Hm.
