# Notes for A is 4


Chapter on "Namco" typeface: with db of mame roms, scan (perl) for that one shape, cross ref with -- if it exists -- a names db that uses md5s like that one for the atari roms. Use meta information from that to build a timeline of font's distribution. Generate a chart showing totals, percentage of market. Ultimately, maybe even add geographic data to follow its movement, if that looks like it'll be significant.
Depending on the actual rate of distribution, it would be interesting to see if there's some other font that lost out.
