# What is this?

This folder is a collection of files related to the bit of writing I want to do about OCR. At this point (October 2012), the immediate plan is that this is my MLA 13 presentation.

I'll be presenting this paper at MLA 13, on a panel with Mark Sample, Lore Emerson and Paul Benzon, as abstracted here:

I feel like I have a lot to say about this, so I think it could become an independent article or maybe part of the book.
